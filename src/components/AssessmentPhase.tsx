//   - no per-question timer: there is ONE budget for the whole test, so no item is speed-scored
//   - no correctness feedback, explanation or reveal: that would teach the item and contaminate

//   - no team / magic / boss / ranking anything

//   startedAt == null  -> waiting; the teacher has not opened the test
//   open               -> answering, with the shared countdown
//   expired / complete -> locked; saved answers stay, nothing is fabricated
